# roketok
A simple rust tokenization library, mostly\
made for convenience so I, nor you have to\
constantly write a new lexer/tokenizer\
everytime you need to. Let's be real, it's really not thst fun to write the samething over again.

Currently roketok isn't aimed for being the best in the game, its far from that.\
But it's meant to be lightweight and simple to use
