A simple tokenization library, focused on ease of use.
Currently **roketok** is very much still under plenty of changes and currently is limited to simple linear tokenization.

If you find an issue, whether is performance or just bugs in general, please submit an issue in [issues](https://github.com/rok3tt/roketok/issues).

### TODO
- [ ] SIMD Support
- [ ] Token Trees
- [ ] Compile Time Tokenizer Generation
